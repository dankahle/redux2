redux:
cna't get user resolve to work with a subject, what? It's an observable right? YOu're using a subject in init guard....


* interceptors
* detail (page too, not just resolve)
* add
* edit
* router path and params in state
* interceptor
* error modal
* progress bar
* initialization

you know everything needs to be redone now right? This is good for you. I.e. it was straight forward and easy to do in angular.
Today's trials will help you make your decision. If today goes like crap, then you maybe have your answer, cause if this goes like crap...
after it's already been implemented in angular, that doesn't say much for doing things in redux. The reverse of that though is: if this goes
easy, that doesn't necessarily mean it woudl have been easy from scratch, i.e. it's a lot easier to take a working angular app and convert it
to redux than to do redux from scratch I bet, as it's already implemented, just needs to be transformed.




rest of weekend:
material comps you haven't done
@angular/flex-layout
material themeing?





other stuff:
