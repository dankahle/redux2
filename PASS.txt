pass:
converting latest angular to redux

todo:
* userState >> resolve? If so, then how to refresh? I.e. if you need a thing before a state, but also need it in the state,
  do you bother to do it before the state? yeah, why not, cleaner start and then other changes wont' be noticeale, it's that missing hole in the page that all a sudden gets fill, that you want to avoid. PRoalem is: how to wait for it after the value is already ther. I.e. you'd clear finished flag, then start right? Oh... isn't dispatch >> reducer sync? there you go, jsut dispatch and same start event will clear finished and start epic



* detail
* add
* edit
* router path and params in state
* interceptor
* error modal
* progress bar
* initialization

you know everything needs to be redone now right? This is good for you. I.e. it was straight forward and easy to do in angular.
Today's trials will help you make your decision. If today goes like crap, then you maybe have your answer, cause if this goes like crap...
after it's already been implemented in angular, that doesn't say much for doing things in redux. The reverse of that though is: if this goes
easy, that doesn't necessarily mean it woudl have been easy from scratch, i.e. it's a lot easier to take a working angular app and convert it
to redux than to do redux from scratch I bet, as it's already implemented, just needs to be transformed.
