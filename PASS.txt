redux:
edit and save left
getDc is hokey as it's all between user/reducer. Should be epic??
make assessment here? at least stop and look at it before routing and filter.
you want to get a bit more in userState so you can see how component properties will possibly move out of component and into userState? That's what userState is there for.

maybe state syoudl be: {users, user} instead and with routing move to a detail sub route then you have usersState and userState and they have users and user properties plus any additional metadata

todo:
routing
filter with query param, i.e. do it on server or pretend to
or do it on component?


then, make your assessment, or maybe make


angular:
you're struggling with the thickness of that User object, and leaning more towards a coordinator, and you still like the shape shifting of redux, so look for a way you can have a api and ui shape of it
