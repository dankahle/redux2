pass:
just started the redux-no-epics branch. This one should be fun. You drop all epics, just use services and sync reducer actions.
This is the middle ground I figure, a way to get a state driven app while chopping the productivity loss in half
(and in the process holding on to your developers? There will be some that simply will not do redux in its current form of async actions)


rest of weekend: (good one)
material comps you haven't done
@angular/flex-layout
material themeing?

other stuff:
* router path and params in state
* redux-freeze?
* immutability?
