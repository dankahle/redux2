pass:
userService.getDc is async, but your'e acting like it's sync,that woudl make toUI async right? Not so easy then, but that's the point isn't it? Make it difficult and see how much harder it is to do in redux.
You'd need to fix that on all 3 branches then

bug:
getAll, getOne not working. what??




redux-no-epics
* drop all epics and use only sync actions, expect this to line up actions instead of them coming in helter skelter
* remove noise from actions (toss: progress bar (back to service on that) and anything else you can to get actions to only what's necessary
* get rid of all garbage in state, the wiating flags, but anything else that you can

goal:
back to observables for async, minimal state and actions, and the actions shoudl all line up chronoligically


redux-version-cleaner: // not sure this is needed, but maybe the no-epics branch will show you a better way to do classical redux?
* remove noise from actions (toss: progress bar (back to service on that) and anything else you can to get actions to only what's necessary
* get rid of all garbage in state, the wiating flags, but anything else that you can

angular-global-state:
* implement your own observable global state service with an update function that does a zone.run and all is sync
goal: to get the same global state as redux, but not drive the app with it, just use it for coordination between components



rest of weekend: (good one)
material comps you haven't done
@angular/flex-layout
material themeing?

other stuff:
* router path and params in state
* redux-freeze?
* immutability?
