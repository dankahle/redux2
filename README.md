## redux2

this is a comparison on a small scale between angular and angular/redux. The two branches are angular-version and redux-version

1. git clone https://github.com/dankahle/redux2.git
2. switch from master branch to either "angular-version" or "redux-version"
3. npm install (i.e. get to the version branch, then "npm install")
4. run "node ./rest-api/server.js" to get a server running on port 3005
5. in root directory: "ng serve" to start the app which will be found at http://localhost;4200
